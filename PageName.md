#Use-cases

# Introduction #

Various use-cases.


  * morning-train.
    * Notification if track changes
    * Notification if time changes
    * Notification about cancelled trains

  * evening-train.
    * Notification if track changes
    * Notification if time changes
    * Notification about cancelled trains
    * Easily browse WHAT track it is, even if it has NOT changed.
    * Handle the case where train 16.56 is CANCELLED, but train 16.37 replaces it and departs from the same platform (but why would it need special handling, otoh?)

In my case, the "selection critera" for this (similar to Locale) is simply time. I always go  by the same trains.
